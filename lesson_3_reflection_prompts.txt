When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working in a team who is collaborating on the same project. Also, when I would like to share my work with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes from remote makes sense I would like to have control over when to sync repository rather than Git automatically stay up-to-date.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is the term used by Github where a user can make a copy/clone of a repository from someone's Github Accoount to his personal Github account.
Clone is used to make copy of a git repository either from remote to local or local to local.
Branches are part of a git repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It helps in tracking. It helps in checking differences between local and remote branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git and Github I would fall back on taking manual backups of files by copying the old ones. It would be very hard at times when there would too many backups. And for collaboration I have to share my files over and over again which will be cumbersome and hard to manage.
