When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I am working in a team who is collaborating on the same project. Also, when I would like to share my work with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes from remote makes sense I would like to have control over when to sync repository rather than Git automatically stay up-to-date.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is the term used by Github where a user can make a copy/clone of a repository from someone's Github Accoount to his personal Github account.
Clone is used to make copy of a git repository either from remote to local or local to local.
Branches are part of a git repository.
